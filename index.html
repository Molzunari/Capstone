<p>These majestic birds have graced the skies for millions of years. They have evolved from therapods,
    so while <br> these birds aren't as fierce as their ancestors, they can still pack a wallop! At Mysterious Birds, we have a wide selection <br>
    of birds ranging from the barn owl, toco toucan, macaw, to small birds like canaries and finches. Our prices <br>
    are fairly reasonable, so it won't put much stress on those on a budget. I'd love to give these birds away to all <br> 
    of you wonderful people, so please, come see these beautiful birds for yourself!
</p>  
<br>
<p> However, I want to inform everyone here that these birds that I have in stock are not the only kinds of birds<br>
    that I have at the moment. I have carefully selected a good handful of upcoming birds that will arrive in the near<br>
    future. If you would like to purchase of these birds in stock, they require a huge amount of space. They get rather<br>
    irritated easily if they are confined to a cage for a set amount of time. Each of the birds' diet vary, so please keep<br>
    that in mind. That being said, it would be an absolute treat once you come in. Take care everyone!
 </p>
<br>
        <h3> Types of birds on stock:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Diurnal Birds of Prey (Accipitriformes)</li>
            <li>Parrots (Psittaciformes)</li>
            <li>Flamingos (Phoenicopteriformes)</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>More birds coming soon!</h4>
